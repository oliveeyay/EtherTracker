# Donations
I was mainly using this app for my own crypto currencies, but I figured out it could be useful for other people too.
If you want to thank me for my work, don't hesitate to donate a beer in bitcoin :)

Also, if you have any idea on how to improve the app, or issues with the app itself, don't hesitate to email me (email address on my Play Store account).
Also number 2, don't hesitate to send me some pull requests if you want to change the app itself (the app is open source).
